        <h1>About the application</h1>
        <p>
          Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text
          characters as standardized sequences of two different signal
          durations, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs. Morse code is
          named after Samuel Morse, an inventor of the telegraph.
